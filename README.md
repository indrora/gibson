## 1 Installation

To receive updates, add the theme as a submodule: 
```
git submodule add --depth=1 git@github.com:indrora/gibson.git themes/gibson
```

Otherwise, you can clone the repo and copy it manually to your theme folder.

You then need to set typo as your theme in your [config file](#32-hugotoml).


## 2 Features

### 2.1 Header autonumbering

You can add auto-numbering to the pages by setting the following parameter in the header of your MD files. The numbering is currently supported by level 3 subheadings.

```
autonumber: true
```

Note that autonumbering starts from h2 tags, hence you need 
to start sections with ## headings. 

```
## First    ->  1 First
### Second  ->  1.1 Second
#### Third  ->  1.1.1 Third
```

### 2.2 Appearance preferences

In your `hugo.toml` file you can specify the preferred theme: 

```
theme = "light | dark | auto"
```

If nothing is set, the default setting is auto.

### 2.3 Dark and light mode images

You can tags to decide if images are displayed in dark or light mode, as GitHub is doing for readmes.

Let's say you have two different versions of an image, setting `#dark` or `#light` does the trick.

```md
![skiplist](skiplist-light.png#light)
![skiplist](skiplist-dark.png#dark)
```

You can of course remove the final tag 
to always show the same image in light and 
dark mode.

### 2.4 Fonts

The fonts in use are [Literata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata) and [Monaspace Argon](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace).

### 2.5 Miscellaneous

Various miscellaneous features: 
- Latex blocks overflows on mobile to prevent having strange alignments;
- Code blocks are displayed with ligatures.

### 2.6 Extending the theme

You can easily modify the existing style by placing custom CSS inside `assets/css/custom.css`
This has priority over existing CSS.

## 3 Configuration example

### 3.1 post.md

```

title: "Search Engine in Rust"
